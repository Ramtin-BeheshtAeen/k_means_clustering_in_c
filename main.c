	As for CLITERAL, it seems to be a custom keyword or function that is used to create a literal instance of a Vector2 object.
	In many programming languages, you can create an instance of an object using a constructor or a factory method.
	The CLITERAL keyword appears to be a shorthand for creating a new Vector2 object with specific values for .x and .y.
	Itâ€™s similar to how you might use new Vector2(x, y) in other languages to create a new vector with those coordinates.
